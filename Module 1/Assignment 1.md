### Q1. If we execute kernel programs in the user mode and user programs in kernel 
mode what are some consequences? 

1. Executing Kernel Programs in User Mode: Kernel programs are designed to run in kernel mode which has all the access to h/w and system services. If you run in user mode. It will not be fully functional and may lead to system failure message, BLUE screen.
2. Executing User Programs in Kernel Mode: generally user written program doesn't have access to h/w, sensors, kernel program and sytem service program. This is done for security reasons and supervised access to system internals. If you run the user program in kernel mode, it will have all the access. That can cause security breach, unsupervised, unlimited resource uses. Also, generally an user program running user mode has process boundary that seprates it from other programs running in system. When u run the program in kernel mode, it loads the program in the kernel space that doesn't have process boundary and it can access or breach into other processes and resources being used by other processes. Also it will have control over process table residing in the kernel space.

### Chat GPT refined my answer: 
1. Executing Kernel Programs in User Mode

    - Kernel programs are designed to run in kernel mode, where they have full access to hardware and system resources.
    - If you try to execute them in user mode, they lose access to privileged instructions, hardware, and critical system services.
    ## Consequences:
        - The program may fail to execute properly or return errors due to restricted access.
        - Critical OS functions (e.g., memory management, device drivers) may not work, leading to system instability or failure.
        - In some cases, it may trigger a system crash, such as a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) in Windows or a Kernel Panic in Linux.

2. Executing User Programs in Kernel Mode

    - Normally, user programs run in user mode, where they are restricted from directly accessing hardware, sensors, and OS internals for security and stability.
    - If a user program runs in kernel mode, it gains full access to system resources, leading to severe issues.
    ## Consequences:
        - Security Breach: The user program bypasses all security mechanisms and can access any part of the system, including sensitive kernel data.
        Unsupervised & Unlimited Resource Usage: The program can take control of CPU, memory, and I/O devices without restrictions, potentially leading to system hangs or crashes.
        - Loss of Process Isolation: Normally, user programs are confined within separate process boundaries to prevent interference with other processes. Running in kernel mode removes these boundaries, allowing the program to access or modify other processesâ€™ data.
        - Process Table Manipulation: The user program can modify the kernelâ€™s process table, giving it control over other processes, leading to data corruption or even system takeover.
        - System Instability: A buggy user program running in kernel mode can crash the entire OS, since there are no safeguards preventing it from executing unsafe operations.
### Q2 : Define three styles of switching from user mode to supervisor mode.
      
     1. Using system call: When you use function like printf() --> at runtime it calls system call like write() and CPU switches to kernel mode to process. Also we can directly use write(),open(),close(),fork() to switch to a kernel mode.
     2. When your processor encounters any Eception or error, it switches to kernel mode to handle it. Also, when using mouse, keyboard when you hit the close button on a file, app. The processor switches to kernel mode to close the app.
     3. Direct Kernel Invokation: A direct jump to kernel mode is an unsafe method where a user program manipulates jump addresses to enter kernel mode without a system call or interrupt.

   ðŸ”¹ How it Works:

    The user program modifies a function pointer or jump address to execute kernel code.
    This can be done through kernel exploits (buffer overflows, pointer overwrites).
    Modern OSes prevent this using protections like Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR).
      - void (*kernel_func)();  // Function pointer to kernel function

      -  int main() {
          -   kernel_func = (void *) 0x80000000;  // Fake kernel address
          -   kernel_func(); // ðŸš¨ Potential crash or privilege escalation
          -   return 0;
      -  }

### How does the operating system provide protection? 
    - Operaring System provides protection by taking different approaches for different component of it.
    1. It implements 2 modes for cpu to run in: User-Mode and Kernel Mode. So it can restricts user-apps and user-programs from accessing system services and h/w directly.
    2. Process Boundary: Each process that gets loaded in the RAM is guarded by process boundary, so either the process or any other process can't breach into each other.
    3. For files on the disk OS implements different level of access control like, read only, write, execute..
    4. Also, it implements authentication system like, pin, password, sensors to control the access of the system
    5. OS can implement different users, admin and can group the resources and kind of access different users may have.
